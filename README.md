# Installation
If you don't already have Scoop, you need to install that first (using Powershell):
```
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

```
scoop add bucket raisercostin https://github.com/raisercostin/raiser-scoop-bucket
scoop install picasa
scoop install picasa-starter
```
